## Web Applications
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.Express.js provides an easy way to create web server and render HTML pages for different HTTP requests by configuring routes for your application.Use app object to define different routes of your application. The app object includes get(), post(), put() and delete() methods to define routes for HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests respectively.

## APIs
With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love. 

## Node.js

Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. It makes possible to create server-side applications with JavaScript language. JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that there is only one thread for execution. But your application can serve lots of connections at the same time. It handles all events without interrupting main thread. This non-blocking execution flow of Node.js makes it one of the fastest platforms to build web applications.

## Express.js

Express.js is a framework, built on top of Node.js, to build single page, multipage or hybrid web applications. It provides broad range of features such as routing, templating.
